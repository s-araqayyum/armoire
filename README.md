You may not be able to sample out a couch when you shop online, but with armoire, you’re a few clicks away from your dream furniture, all from the comfort of your own home. Armoire is an ecommerce store, that inculcates ideas of selling furniture from a primary vendor – with modules of ordering, inventories,  payments and more – all packed in the varying views of a vendor and their many customers.

The repository contains a modular form of an inventory management system – the heart of armoire. A data driven approach was used to perform all the relevant operations needed to manage armoire’s inventory with ease through the lens of a MERN stack application.
